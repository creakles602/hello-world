Introduction to Git Hub
As an IAM Architect focusing on Okta I have a requirement to understand different implementation paths for SAML2.0 to integrate applications with Okta using the SAML2.0 standard. GitHub currently has a number of different projects relating to SAML2.0 and to be able to work with these projects and assist developers with their integration I am wading into the GitHub pool.
